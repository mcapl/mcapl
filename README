This software distribution consists of:

- The Agent JPF (AJPF) extention of the Java Pathfinder model checker for model checking BDI style agent programs.

- The Agent Infrastructure Layer (AIL) toolkit for prototyping interpreters for BDI-style agent programming languages.

- The Gwendolen BDI agent programming language.

- The EASS (Engineering Autonomous Space Software) variant of the Gwendolen Language

- The Ethical Gwendolen variant of the Gwendolen Language

- The AIL Implementation of the GOAL BDI agent programming language (AIL GOAL).

- A Declarative Ethical Governor (DEG) Implementation

- A Really Simple Motorway Simulation (RSMS)

src/classes and src/main contains the core classes for each of these libraries 
   - when Java Pathfinder is being used the classes in src/classes run in the JPF virtual machine while those in src/main run in the native virtual machine
   
src/examples contains a number of example programs 

src/peers contains alternative implementations for some methods and classes for use during model checking to increase efficiency by doing some
   processing natively.  This code is not used in normal operation.
   
src/tests contains regression tests.

Documentation including installation instructions can be found in the doc folder
