This is the sixth in a series of tutorials on the use of the
\gwendolen\ programming language.  This tutorial covers finer control
of intentions by suspending and locking them.  It also looks at how
goals can be
dropped.\index{Gwendolen}\index{intention}\index{intention!suspension}\index{intention!locking}

\section{Wait For: Suspending Intentions}\index{Gwendolen}\index{waitfor}\index{intention}\index{intention!suspension}

Recall the sample answer to the second exercise
\intutorial{\gwendolen}{3}{tutorial:gwendolen:guards} in which we had
to introduce a ``do nothing'' action in order to delay the replanning
of an achievement goal.  In the code in
Example~\ref{code:pickuprubble_waitfor} we use, instead some new
syntax \lstinline{*checked(X, Y)} which means \emph{wait until
  $checked(X, Y)$ is true before
  continuing.}\index{example!pickuprubble}\index{waitfor}

      ~square_to_check(X, Y), ~holding(rubble), at(2, 2);

:Initial Goals:

:Plans:

+!all_squares_checked [achieve] : 
     {B square_to_check(X, Y), ~B holding(rubble)} <- 
          move_to(X, Y), *checked(X, Y);
+!all_squares_checked [achieve] : {B holding(rubble)} <- 
     move_to(2, 2), drop;

+rubble(X, Y) : {~B at(2, 2)} <- lift_rubble, +checked(X, Y);

+at(X, Y) : {~B rubble(X, Y)} <- +checked(X, Y);
+at(2, 2) : {True} <- +checked(2, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ourexample}
\end{figure}
We have adapted the program so that after moving to the square (X, Y)
the agent waits until it believes it has checked that square.  Then we
delay the addition of that belief until after the agent as lifted
rubble.\index{Gwendolen}\index{waitfor} 

If you run this program with logging for
\texttt{ail.semantics.AILAgent}\index{logging}\index{Gwendolen!logging}\index{AILAgent
  (class)}, you will see that the intention is marked as
\texttt{SUSPENDED} when the wait for deed is
encountered.\index{intention}\index{waitfor}\index{intention!suspension} 
\begin{verbatim}
SUSPENDED
source(self):: 
   *  +!_aall_squares_checked()||True||+*...checked(1,1)()||[X-1, Y-1]
   *  start||True||+!_aall_squares_checked()()||[]
\end{verbatim}
Once an intention is suspended it can not become the current intention until it is unsuspended.  In the case of the wait for command this happens when the predicate that is waiting for is believed.  Below you can see how this happens when \texttt{checked(1, 1)} is added to the belief base.\index{intention}\index{Gwendolen}\index{intention!suspension}\index{intention!current}

\end{verbatim}

The wait for command is particularly useful in simulated or physical
environments where actions may take some time to complete.  It allows
the agent to continue operating (e.g., performing error monitoring)
while waiting until it recognises that an action has finished before
continuing with what it was
doing.\index{Gwendolen}\index{waitfor}\index{action}\index{action!with
  duration} 


\section{Lock and Unlock: Preventing interleaving of Intentions}\index{intention}\index{intention!locking}\index{lock}\index{unlock}\index{Gwendolen}
In the code in Example~\ref{code:pickuprubble_nolock} we have
complicated our agent's situation a little.  This agent has to explore
squares (0, 0) to (0, 5) as well as the squares it was exploring
previously.  It also has to switch warning lights on and off before
and after it lifts rubble.  Lastly if a warning sounds it must stop
searching and move to square (0, 0) until it is able to continue
searching again.\index{example!pickuprubble} 

We use some new syntax here.  
\begin{itemize}
\item At line 34 we have an empty plan.  This can be useful in
  situations where we don't want to raise a ``no plan'' warning but we
  don't want the agent to actually do
  anything.\index{plan}\index{plan!empty} 
\item At line 36 we have a plan triggered by \lstinline{-warning}.
  This is a plan that is triggered when something is no longer
  believed (in this case that the warning sound can no longer be
  heard).\index{plan}\index{plan!trigger} 
\item At line 37 we include the deed, \lstinline{-search_mode} in a
  plan.  This is an instruction to remove a
  belief.\index{belief}\index{belief!remove}\index{Gwendolen} 
\end{itemize}

     {B search_mode, B square_to_check(X, Y), ~B holding(rubble)} <- 
          move_to(X, Y), *checked(X, Y);
+!all_squares_checked [achieve] : {B holding(rubble)};

-warning: {True} <- +search_mode;
+warning: {True} <- -search_mode, move_to(0, 0);

+rubble(X, Y) : {~B at(2, 2)} <- 
     warning_lights_on, 
     lift_rubble, 
     warning_lights_off, 
     move_to(2, 2), 
     drop, 
     +checked(X, Y);

+at(X, Y) : {~B rubble(X, Y)} <- +checked(X, Y);
+at(2, 2) : {True} <- +checked(2, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ourexample}\index{Gwendolen}\index{example!pickuprubble}
\end{figure}
The agent in Example~\ref{code:pickuprubble_nolock} uses a belief,
\lstinline{search_mode} to control whether it is actively searching
squares or whether it is returning to to the ``safe'' square (0,0) in
order to wait for the warning to switch off.   

Run this program and see if you can spot a problem with its execution.

Hopefully you observed an output something like:
\begin{verbatim}
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done move_to(0,1) 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done move_to(0,2) 
gwendolen.tutorials.SearchAndRescueEnv[INFO|main|10:31:44]: Warning is Sounding 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done warning_lights_on 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done move_to(0,0) 
gwendolen.tutorials.SearchAndRescueEnv[INFO|main|10:31:44]: Warning Ceases 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done lift_rubble 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done warning_lights_off 
ail.mas.DefaultEnvironment[INFO|main|10:31:44]: robot done move_to(2,2) 
\end{verbatim}
So \emph{before} the robot lifts the rubble at square (0, 2) it has
moved to square (0, 0) because the warning has sounded.  This is
happening because \gwendolen\ executes the top deed from each
intention in turn.  So it executes \lstinline{warning_lights_on} from
the intention triggered by finding rubble, then it moves to (0, 0)
from the intention triggered by hearing the warning and then it lifts
the rubble (next in the intention to do with seeing the
rubble).\index{Gwendolen}\index{intention}\index{intention!execution
  order} 

This situation often arises where there are a sequence of deeds that
need to be performed \emph{without interference} from other intentions
such as moving to the wrong place.  To overcome this \gwendolen\ has a
special deed, \lstinline{.lock} which ``locks'' an intention in place
and forces \gwendolen\ to execute deeds from that intention
\emph{only} until the intention is unlocked.  The syntax
\lstinline{+.lock} locks an intention and the syntax
\lstinline{-.lock} unlocks an
intention.\index{Gwendolen}\index{intention}\index{intention!locking}\index{lock}\index{unlock} 

\paragraph{Exercise} Add a lock and an unlock to
\verb+pickuprubble_lock+ in order to force it to pick up the rubble
before obeying the warning.\index{Gwendolen!exercises}

NB. As usual you can find a sample solution in \texttt{/src/examples/gwendolen/tutorials/tutorial6/answers}
\end{sloppypar}

\section{Dropping Goals}\index{Gwendolen}\index{goal}\index{goal!drop}

As a final note as well as dropping beliefs as a deed in plans (as we
are doing with \lstinline{warning} and \lstinline{search_mode} in the
programs here, it is possible to drop goals with the syntax
\lstinline{-!goalname [goaltype]} - e.g.,
\lstinline{-!all_squares_checked  [achieve]}.\index{goal}\index{goal!drop}\index{plan} 

Goal drops can appear in the deeds of plans but can not\footnote{at
  least not at present.} be  used to trigger
plans.\index{goal}\index{goal!drop}\index{Gwendolen} 

\paragraph{Exercise} Write a program for picking up and moving rubble
which, on hearing the warning sound, drops all its goals and leaves
the area (use the action \texttt{leave}).\index{Gwendolen!exercises}
