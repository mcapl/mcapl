\chapter{Introduction}

The \mcapl{} software is a suite of tools for building interpreters
for agent programming languages and the model checking programs
executing in those interpreters.  

This is, unfortunately, only a very minimal manual which seeks to cover the basics of installation and operation.

{\bf Note} This release comes packaged with Jar files for NASA's Java Pathfinder (JPF) tool, the leJOS Java based operating system for Lego NXT robots, and a number of other libraries.  The relevant jars, zip files of source code and the NASA license can be found in \texttt{lib/3rdparty}.  The release is configured to run using the version of JPF packaged with it, but this means that some of its configuration for JPF is non-standard and some adaptation may be required to run it on systems where JPF is already installed.
